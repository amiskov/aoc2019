# Day 2

## Function Trace
With [trace tools](https://github.com/clojure/tools.trace) it's possible to check all evaluation steps. We can trace/untrace functions and whole namespace.

Very helpful while debugging recursion.

## Calva Output Panel
`Cmd+Shift+U` â€” toggle Output panel.

To interrupt running evaluations click right on Output panel and choose according menu item. All debugging printing will be shown.
